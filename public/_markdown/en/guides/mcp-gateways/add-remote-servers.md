Add remote MCP servers

# Add remote MCP servers

Use this guide if you want to connect an existing  server that Arcade does not host. You will add the server to your Arcade project, expose its tools in , and call those  from Arcade SDKs.

## Outcomes

Register a remote  server and use its  in gateways and SDKs.

### You will Learn

-   Add a remote  server to an Arcade
-   Configure advanced connection settings
-   Use the server tools in  Gateways and SDKs

### Prerequisites

-   An [Arcade](https://app.arcade.dev/register)

-   A remote  server URL that Arcade can reach
-   Access to any auth credentials your server requires

## Why use MCP Gateways for Remote MCP Servers

 Gateways let you manage and filter tools in one place, so your agent or team uses a curated set of tools across clients. This is especially useful for remote MCP servers, where you may not have control over the tools available. By using , you can select the  you want to use and hide the ones you don’t want to use.

## Add the remote server to your project

### Open the MCP servers page

Go to the [MCP servers dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/servers)  for your  and click **Add server**.

### Enter the required fields

Arcade requires two fields for remote  servers:

-   **ID**: A unique, human-readable identifier (for example, `render-mcp-server`)
-   **URI**: The public URL for your  server (for example, `https://mcp.render.com/mcp`)

Use the [MCP Debugger](https://mcpdebugger.dev)  to verify the remote server’s  compliance before adding it to Arcade.

### Save and confirm the connection

Create the server and confirm that Arcade lists the server tools in your project. If the remote  server requires authentication, Arcade will prompt you to complete the OAuth flow.

Arcade pre-loads the list of tools available to the user who configures the remote  server so that you can filter them by your own criteria in your . Be sure to connect as an ‘admin’ user who has access to the broadest selection of tools in the remote server. Arcade then re-load the list of tools for every user using your  - if a  is not available to the agent’s end-, it will not be available via the gateway.

## Configure advanced settings

Remote  servers often require more than a URL. Use **Advanced settings** to configure connection, OAuth, and header details.

Common settings include:

-   **Connection settings**: Configure timeout and retry values for  calls.
-   **OAuth2 authorization (optional)**: Add client ID and client secret, and set an authorization URL if it differs from the  server URI. Use the provided redirect URI when configuring your OAuth app.
-   **Custom headers**: Add headers such as `Authorization` or `X-API-Key` and reference secrets with `${secret:NAME}`.
-   **Header secrets**: Store API tokens or passwords and reference them in headers.

## Use remote tools in MCP Gateways

Once the server is registered, its tools show up in the Playground for this project, as well as in the  Gateway  picker.

1.  Create or edit an  Gateway in the [MCP Gateways dashboard](https://app.arcade.dev/mcp-gateways)
     .
2.  Open **Select ** and filter by your remote server name.
3.  Choose the  you want to expose through the gateway.

## Call remote tools from Arcade SDKs

Remote tools behave like any other Arcade . Try it out in the Playground first to learn any nuances about the name and arguments. Copy the tool name from the tool picker or tool catalog, then call it with the SDK.

### Python

```python
from arcade import Arcade

client = Arcade(api_key="ARCADE_API_KEY")

result = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="render-mcp-server.get_key_value",
    input={"keyValueId": "foo-bar"},
    user_id="user-123",
)

print(result)
```

### TypeScript

```typescript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcade";

const client = new Arcade({ apiKey: "ARCADE_API_KEY" });

const result = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "render-mcp-server.get_key_value",
  input: { keyValueId: "foo-bar" },
  user_id: "user-123",
});

console.log(result);
```

## Limitations and caveats

Remote servers must be reachable from Arcade and must support the Streamable HTTP(s) transport. If your server depends on non-HTTP  transports, Arcade cannot proxy it.

-   If the remote server is offline, gateway and SDK calls will fail until it is reachable again.
-    Gateways only expose the tools you select, not every  on the server.
-   Arcade only supports tools from remote  servers today. Prompts, resources, and sampling are not supported yet.
