# About Arcade

Applications that use models to perform tasks (_agentic applications_) commonly require access to sensitive data and services. Authentication complexities often hinder AI from performing tasks that require \-specific information, like what emails were recently received or what’s coming up on a calendar.

To retrieve this information, agentic applications need to be able to authenticate and authorize access to external services like Gmail or Google Calendar.

Authenticating to retrieve information, however, is not the only challenge. Agentic applications also need to authenticate to **act** on behalf of  - like sending an email or updating a calendar.

Without auth, AI  are severely limited in what they can do.

## How Arcade solves this

Arcade provides an authorization system that handles OAuth 2.0, , and user tokens needed by AI  to access external services through . This means AI agents can now act on behalf of  securely and privately.

With Arcade, developers can now create  that can _act as the end  of their application_ to perform tasks like:

-   Creating a new Zoom meeting
-   Sending or reading email
-   Answering questions about files in Google Drive.

## Auth permissions and scopes

Each tool in Arcade’s  servers has a set of required permissions - or, more commonly referred to in OAuth 2.0, **scopes**. For example, the [`Gmail.SendEmail`](/resources/integrations/productivity/gmail.md#gmailsendemail)  requires the [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#gmail) scope.

A scope is what the user has authorized someone else (in this case, the AI agent) to do on their behalf. In any OAuth 2.0-compatible service, each kind of action requires a different set of permissions. This gives the user fine-grained control over what data third-party services can access and what actions they can take in their .

When an agent calls a tool, if the user has not granted the required permissions,  will automatically prompt the user to authorize the  and coordinate the OAuth 2.0 flow with the service provider.

## How to implement OAuth 2.0-authorized tool calling

## Tools that don’t require authorization

Some , like [`GoogleSearch.Search`](/resources/integrations/search/google_search.md#googlesearchsearch), allow AI  to retrieve information or perform actions without needing \-specific authorization.

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(api_key="arcade_api_key") # or set the ARCADE_API_KEY env var

# Use the GoogleSearch.Searchtool to perform a web search

response = await client.tools.execute(
tool_name="GoogleSearch.Search",
input={"query": "Latest AI advancements"},
)
print(response.output.value)

```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the ARCADE_API_KEY env variable

// Use the GoogleSearch.Search tool to perform a web search
const response = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "GoogleSearch.Search",
  input: { query: "Latest AI advancements" },
});
console.log(response.output.value);
```
