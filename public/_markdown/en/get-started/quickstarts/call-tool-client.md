Call tools in IDE/MCP clients

# Call a tool in your IDE/MCP Client

Tools enable your AI agents to perform actions on your behalf. For specific workflows and use cases, this may involve calling tools from multiple  servers. Arcade facilitates this by allowing you to create MCP Gateways to federate the tools from multiple MCP servers into a single collection for convenient management, control, and access. For example, if your agent specializes in solving specific tickets in Linear, you may want to use tools from the GitHub, Slack and Linear servers in your agent. These add up to 88 tools, which could be overwhelming for an LLM to use effectively. What you want is to get from these servers only the tools that matter for your agent. An  allows you to do just that: pick only the tools required for this workflow, and you can connect it to any MCP client, making it possible to port your  to multiple platforms and IDEs, and even share it with other .

## Outcomes

Create a coding agent using an  Gateway to call tools from multiple .

### You will Learn

-   Create an  Gateway
-   Connect the  Gateway to Cursor or VS Code
-   Call tools from the  Gateway in your

### Prerequisites

-   An [Arcade](https://app.arcade.dev/register)


### Create an MCP Gateway

**Create a new  Gateway.** Go to the [MCP Gateways dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/mcp-gateways) , and click the “Create ” button.

Give your  gateway:

-   A name
-   A description
-   A slug (this is recommended so it’s easy to remember and share, but will be generated if left blank)
-   Select the Authentication mode for the  Gateway
    -   **Arcade Auth**: To access the  Gateway, you’ll need to authenticate with your Arcade  in an OAuth flow on a browser. For security, the token is only valid for a short time and your MCP client will need to refresh it periodically.
    -   **Arcade Headers**: To access the  Gateway, you’ll need to authenticate with your Arcade account by passing an  key in the `Authorization` header and the  ID in the `Arcade-User-ID` header. Use this authentication mode for MCP clients that don’t support browser authentication or token refresh.

### Select the tools you want to include in the gateway

**Click the “Select ” button** in the form to select the tools you want to include in the gateway. You can select tools from any  server available to the active . For this example, select the following tools:

-   the GitHub  server
-   the Linear  server

Feel free to select any  you want to include in your specific use case.

![Tool Picker](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fmcp-gateway%2Fmcp-gateway-tool-filter-dev-light.png&w=3840&q=75)![Tool Picker](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fmcp-gateway%2Fmcp-gateway-tool-filter-dev-dark.png&w=3840&q=75)

Once you’ve selected the tools you want to include in the gateway, click the “Use N tools” button in the tool picker, and then click the “Create  Gateway” button to create the gateway.

You can select as many tools for your  Gateway as you want, but be mindful of how the MCP clients will handle the large number of tools. Some clients may not handle a large number of tools well, and may consume a significant portion of the LLM’s context window. We recommend keeping the number of tools in a single  below 80.\`\`\`

### Connect the MCP Gateway to an MCP client

Arcade  Gateways are compatible with any MCP client that supports:

-   Streamable HTTP transport
-    OAuth, or support for setting up headers for the HTTP transport

Get the URL of your  Gateway by clicking the “Copy URL” button in the  details page.

Select the  client you want to use to read the instructions to connect to the :

### Try it out

1.  Open your IDE’s chat pane.
2.  Ask the  to do something! For example, “Check the latest linear issue assigned to me. Then, create a new GitHub branch, implement the fix, and add tests. If all the tests pass, create a pull request and assign it to me.”

As you interact with the agent, it will call the tools from the  Gateway. Your  should prompt you to visit links to authorize access to Linear and GitHub. After this, it will start using  to carry out the task! Subsequent calls will not require authorization.
